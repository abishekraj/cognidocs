# LineRadial

The radial line generator produces a spline or polyline, as in a line chart. A radial line generator is equivalent to the standard Cartesian line generator, except the x and y accessors are replaced with angle and radius accessors. Radial lines are always positioned relative to ⟨0,0⟩; use a transform (see: SVG, Canvas) to change the origin. The generic refers to the data type of an element in the input array passed into the line generator.
