# Symbol

A symbol generator. Symbols provide a categorical shape encoding as is commonly used in scatterplots. Symbols are always centered at ⟨0,0⟩; use a transform (see: SVG, Canvas) to move the arc to a different position. The first generic corresponds to the "this" context within which the symbol generator is invoked. The second generic corresponds to the data type of the datum underlying the symbol.
