# Stack

A stack generator. Some shape types can be stacked, placing one shape adjacent to another. For example, a bar chart of monthly sales might be broken down into a multi-series bar chart by product category, stacking bars vertically. This is equivalent to subdividing a bar chart by an ordinal dimension (such as product category) and applying a color encoding. Stacked charts can show overall value and per-category value simultaneously; however, it is typically harder to compare across categories, as only the bottom layer of the stack is aligned. So, chose the stack order carefully, and consider a streamgraph. (See also grouped charts.) Like the pie generator, the stack generator does not produce a shape directly. Instead it computes positions which you can then pass to an area generator or use directly, say to position bars. The first generic corresponds to the "this" context in which the stack generator and its accessor functions are invoked. The second generic corresponds to the data type of an element in the data array passed into the stack generator. The third generic corresponds to the data type of key used to identify a series.
