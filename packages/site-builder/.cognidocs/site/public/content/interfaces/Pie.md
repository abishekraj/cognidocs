# Pie

The pie generator does not produce a shape directly, but instead computes the necessary angles to represent a tabular dataset as a pie or donut chart; these angles can then be passed to an arc generator. The first generic corresponds to the type of the "this" context within which the pie generator and its accessor functions will be invoked. The second generic refers to the data type of an element in the input array passed into the Pie generator.
