# Arc

The arc generator produces a circular or annular sector, as in a pie or donut chart. If the difference between the start and end angles (the angular span) is greater than τ, the arc generator will produce a complete circle or annulus. If it is less than τ, arcs may have rounded corners and angular padding. Arcs are always centered at ⟨0,0⟩; use a transform (see: SVG, Canvas) to move the arc to a different position. See also the pie generator, which computes the necessary angles to represent an array of data as a pie or donut chart; these angles can then be passed to an arc generator. The first generic corresponds to the type of the "this" context within which the arc generator and its accessor functions will be invoked. The second generic corresponds to the datum type for which the arc is to be generated.
