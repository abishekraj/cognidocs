# AreaRadial

A radial area generator. A radial area generator is equivalent to the standard Cartesian area generator, except the x and y accessors are replaced with angle and radius accessors. Radial areas are always positioned relative to ⟨0,0⟩; use a transform (see: SVG, Canvas) to change the origin. The generic refers to the data type of an element in the input array passed into the area generator.
