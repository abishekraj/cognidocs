# ScaleIdentity

Identity scales are a special case of linear scales where the domain and range are identical; the scale and its invert method are thus the identity function. These scales are occasionally useful when working with pixel coordinates, say in conjunction with an axis. The generic corresponds to the data type of the unknown value.
