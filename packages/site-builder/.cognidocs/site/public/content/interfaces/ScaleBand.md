# ScaleBand

Band scales are like ordinal scales except the output range is continuous and numeric. Discrete output values are automatically computed by the scale by dividing the continuous range into uniform bands. Band scales are typically used for bar charts with an ordinal or categorical dimension. The unknown value of a band scale is effectively undefined: they do not allow implicit domain construction. The generic corresponds to the data type of domain elements.
