# ContourDensity

A contour generator for density estimates. The generic refers to the data type of an element in the data array used with the density contour generator. If omitted, the default setting assumes that, the elements of the data array used with the density contour generator are two-element arrays. The first element corresponds to the x-dimension, the second to the y-dimension.
