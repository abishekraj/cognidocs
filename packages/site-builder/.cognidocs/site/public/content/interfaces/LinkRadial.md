# LinkRadial

Shorthand for d3.link with d3.curveBumpY; suitable for visualizing links in a tree diagram rooted on the top edge of the display. The first generic corresponds to the type of the "this" context within which the radial link generator and its accessor functions will be invoked. The second generic corresponds to the datum type of the link object for which the link is to be generated. The third generic corresponds to the datum type of the source/target node contained in the link object.
