# ScaleLogarithmic

A continuous logarithmic scale defined over a numeric domain. Continuous scales map a continuous, quantitative input domain to a continuous output range. The mapping to the range value y can be expressed as a function of the domain value x: y = m log(x) + b. As log(0) = -∞, a log scale domain must be strictly-positive or strictly-negative; the domain must not include or cross zero. A log scale with a positive domain has a well-defined behavior for positive values, and a log scale with a negative domain has a well-defined behavior for negative values. (For a negative domain, input and output values are implicitly multiplied by -1.) The behavior of the scale is undefined if you pass a negative value to a log scale with a positive domain or vice versa. If the range is also numeric, the mapping may be inverted. Note that the data types of the range and output of the scale must be compatible with the interpolator applied by the scale. The first generic corresponds to the data type of the range elements. The second generic corresponds to the data type of the output elements generated by the scale. The third generic corresponds to the data type of the unknown value. If range element and output element type differ, the interpolator factory used with the scale must match this behavior and convert the interpolated range element to a corresponding output element.
