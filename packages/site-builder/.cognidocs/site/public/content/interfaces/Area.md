# Area

The area generator produces an area, as in an area chart. An area is defined by two bounding lines, either splines or polylines. Typically, the two lines share the same x-values (x0 = x1), differing only in y-value (y0 and y1); most commonly, y0 is defined as a constant representing zero. The first line (the topline) is defined by x1 and y1 and is rendered first; the second line (the baseline) is defined by x0 and y0 and is rendered second, with the points in reverse order. With a curveLinear curve, this produces a clockwise polygon. The generic refers to the data type of an element in the input array passed into the area generator.
