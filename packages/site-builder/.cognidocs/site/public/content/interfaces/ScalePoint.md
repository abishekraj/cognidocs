# ScalePoint

Point scales are a variant of band scales with the bandwidth fixed to zero. Point scales are typically used for scatterplots with an ordinal or categorical dimension. The unknown value of a point scale is always undefined: they do not allow implicit domain construction. The generic corresponds to the data type of domain elements.
