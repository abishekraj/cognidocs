# ForceRadial

The radial force is similar to the x- and y-positioning forces, except it pushes nodes towards the closest point on a given circle. The circle is of the specified radius centered at ⟨x,y⟩. If x and y are not specified, they default to ⟨0,0⟩. The strength of the force is proportional to the one-dimensional distance between the node’s position and the target position. While this force can be used to position individual nodes, it is intended primarily for global forces that apply to all (or most) nodes. The generic refers to the type of data for a node.
