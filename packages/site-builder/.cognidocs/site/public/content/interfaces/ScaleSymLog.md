# ScaleSymLog

A bi-symmetric log transformation for wide-range data by Webber scale defined over a numeric domain. Continuous scales map a continuous, quantitative input domain to a continuous output range. See “A bi-symmetric log transformation for wide-range data” by Webber for more If the range is also numeric, the mapping may be inverted. Note that the data types of the range and output of the scale must be compatible with the interpolator applied by the scale. The first generic corresponds to the data type of the range elements. The second generic corresponds to the data type of the output elements generated by the scale. The third generic corresponds to the data type of the unknown value. If range element and output element type differ, the interpolator factory used with the scale must match this behavior and convert the interpolated range element to a corresponding output element.
