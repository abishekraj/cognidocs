# ForceY

The y-positioning force pushes nodes towards a desired position along the given dimension with a configurable strength. The strength of the force is proportional to the one-dimensional distance between the node’s position and the target position. While this force can be used to position individual nodes, it is intended primarily for global forces that apply to all (or most) nodes. The generic refers to the type of data for a node.
