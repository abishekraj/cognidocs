# ScaleTime

A linear scale defined over a temporal domain. Time scales implement ticks based on calendar intervals, taking the pain out of generating axes for temporal domains. If the range is numeric, the mapping may be inverted to return a date. Note that the data types of the range and output of the scale must be compatible with the interpolator applied by the scale. The first generic corresponds to the data type of the range elements. The second generic corresponds to the data type of the output elements generated by the scale. The third generic corresponds to the data type of the unknown value. If range element and output element type differ, the interpolator factory used with the scale must match this behavior and convert the interpolated range element to a corresponding output element.
