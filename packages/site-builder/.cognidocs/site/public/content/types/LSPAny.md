# LSPAny

The LSP any type. In the current implementation we map LSPAny to any. This is due to the fact that the TypeScript compilers can't infer string access signatures for interface correctly (it can though for types). See the following issue for details: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15300. When the issue is addressed LSPAny can be defined as follows: ```ts export type LSPAny = LSPObject | LSPArray | string | integer | uinteger | decimal | boolean | null | undefined; export type LSPObject = { [key: string]: LSPAny }; export type LSPArray = LSPAny[]; ``` Please note that strictly speaking a property with the value `undefined` can't be converted into JSON preserving the property name. However for convenience it is allowed and assumed that all these properties are optional as well.
